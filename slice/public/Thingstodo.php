                Hall Ranch has something for just about everyone. The most commonly ridden trail (Bitterbrush) has a challenging technical Rock Garden that only fit expert riders can clean bottom to top. The Nelson Loop up top has some beautiful views of the Arapahoe range and Longs Peak in addition to beautiful, flowy singletrack. Intermediate riders can find some suitable terrain by starting on the Antelope Trail, that also leads to the Nelson trail, but bypasses the technical Rock Garden on Bitterbrush.

It won a Governor’s Award for Downtown Excellence in 2010. As a public community art project, a mural depicting life in Lyons, called “Lyons Past, Present and Future”, was placed on the outdoor wall of the Visitor Center in June 2003. At that time, the group gave itself the name Confluence Community Arts (CoCoA). It is mainly run by Cathy Rivers and Priscalla Cohan, who have gone on to start a second project, called The Clarifier Project, which involves the community painting tiles to decorate the old circular cement building next to St. Vrain Creek. </p>

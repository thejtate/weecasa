              <p>Om Ah Homes is a family owned and operated tiny home construction company in Denver, CO, whose main focus is on simplicity with modern, minimalistic designs.  To describe our homes in one word would be: SPACIOUS.  Our homes are extra wide with high ceilings, providing a feeling of openness and room to be and live, yet still these homes are very easily transported to your ideal location.  Our design focus is on constructing homes with plenty of space, inviting the outside in, and allowing for the feel of a real home.

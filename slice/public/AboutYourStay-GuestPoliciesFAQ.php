          So that we may provide the best experience for you and our future guests,<br>
          WeeCasa requests that you agree to the following policies:
        </p>
      </div>

      <br>
      <div class="text-large">
        <h6>RESERVATIONS</h6>
        <p>
          Reservations can be made by phone or online through our website. Full payment is required with a valid credit card at the time the reservation is made. We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover and American Express. As soon as we receive your reservation, we’ll email you back a confirmation and a receipt after your credit card has been charged.
        </p>
        <h6>CHECK-IN / CHECK-OUT</h6>
        <p>
          Check-in time begins at 2:00 pm. Early arrival requests cannot be guaranteed, but we’ll try our best! Upon check-in you’ll be asked to fill out any necessary paperwork and consent to our Guest Policies. Check-out time is 10:00 am. Late check-out cannot be guaranteed. An extra fee may apply for late check-outs. On rare occasions, there may be some variation to check-in/check-out times based on event times, occupancy, and staffing.
        </p>
        <h6>CANCELLATION POLICY</h6>
        <p>
          WeeCasa understands that sometimes travel plans change. In order to receive a refund, you must call us at least 14 days prior to your scheduled arrival date!  There are no refunds for cancellations made within 14 days of your scheduled arrival date or for no-shows.
        </p>
        <h6>
          TINY HOME SUBSTITUTION
        </h6>
        <p>
          WeeCasa reserves the right to substitute a Tiny Home of similar or greater value than specified in the guest’s reservation should the situation require it.
        </p>
        <h6>
          PETS
        </h6>
        <p>
          Although we love pets, we do not allow them on our property or in the Tiny Homes with the exception of Service Animals.  An additional cleaning fee of $250 will be charged to any guest who violates this policy.  Please notify us prior to check-in that you will bringing your Service Animal.  Definition of a Service Animal:  Per Colorado House Bill 16-1426, Section 1 (b), “The term ‘service animal’ has a distinct meaning in the law. A service animal means a dog or miniature horse trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability and whose work or task is directly related to the individual’s disability. Under the law, the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship does not constitute the work or tasks of a service animal.”  Intentional misrepresentation of entitlement to an assistance animal is a criminal offense.
        </p>
        <h6>
          SMOKING
        </h6>
        <p>
          All of our Wee Casas are 100% non-smoking. THIS INCLUDES ALL TYPES OF SMOKING! An additional cleaning fee of $250 will be charged to any guest who violates the smoking policy.
        </p>
        <h6>
          RESPECTING OTHER USES AT RIVER BEND
        </h6>
        <p>
          A portion of the beautiful River Bend property is designated as a wedding and special event venue managed by the Lyons Farmette. Although there will be a clear separation of the Wee Casa and the wedding event grounds, we ask that you please be respectful of private events, stay within the Wee Casa designated areas, and be mindful of your noise level. Quiet hours begin at 10:00 pm in respect of our neighbors – this is STRICTLY ENFORCED by property management. Unfortunately, sound is amplified in this valley, so “after parties” will not be tolerated on the property. After your event, feel free to gather at one of the great bars or restaurants in Lyons. Town is a two-minute walk away.
        </p>
        <h6>
          PARKING
        </h6>
        <p>
          There will be plenty of parking for your River Bend event, and at least one parking space for each tiny home unit.
        </p>
        <h6>
          MOBILITY ISSUES
        </h6>
        <p>
          Each of our Wee Casas offers a unique arrangement for sleeping, eating and relaxing. Some Wee Casas have a queen-size bed on the main level plus a sleeping loft accessible by a ladder or stairs. Others do not have lofts. Be sure to check our website for a detailed description of each Wee Casa! Please note that our Wee Casas are not wheelchair accessible. Unfortunately, most tiny homes cannot accommodate wheelchairs simply due to their size. By consenting to these terms, you agree that you accept the conditions in the tiny home that you are reserving. WeeCasa is not liable for any personal injuries resulting from staying in or using the Wee Casa. The signer indemnifies and holds WeeCasa harmless against any and all such claims, including attorney’s fee incurred in defense of such claims.

        <h6>
          CLEANING
        </h6>
        <p>
          We pride ourselves on being an environmentally friendly hotel. Guests are encouraged to participate in our green policies by re-using their towels for the duration of their stay, and conserving water. The Wee Casas are cleaned before new guests arrive, but we do not provide room service or cleaning during your stay. However, for guests staying more than three days, we are happy to supply fresh linens and schedule a cleaning upon request.
        </p>
        <h6>
          DAMAGE
        </h6>
        <p>
          While accidents do happen, registered guests will be held financially responsible for all damages to the property or missing items discovered during their stay and/or immediately upon departure.
        </p>
        <h6>
          WAIT LIST
        </h6>
        <p>
          WeeCasa maintains a wait list for nights that are fully booked. To be placed on the wait list, email us at info@WeeCasa.com and include the following information so that we can contact you quickly in the event that a Wee Casa becomes available:  your phone number, arrival and departure dates, and number of people in your party.  If a Wee Casa becomes available before the arrival date, we will work through the list to see if wait listed guests would like to complete their reservation.  We may include a response time limit, after which we will call another guest from the wait list.
        </p>
        <h6>
          LIABILITY
        </h6>
        <p>
          And here’s the extra fine print… WeeCasa accepts no liability and will not pay any compensation where the performance of its obligations is prevented or affected directly or indirectly by or as a result of force majeure or any circumstances beyond its reasonable control including, but not limited to, flood, earthquake, extreme adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, other acts of God, acts of terrorism, fire or failure of electric power, gas, water, or other utility service, plant machinery, computers, vehicles or any collapse of building structures. WeeCasa will not be responsible for the loss or damage of any property left in a tiny home other than as required under Colorado law. WeeCasa will not be liable for any indirect, consequential loss or pure economic loss (whether caused by the negligence of the Company, its employees, contractor or agents or otherwise). The Company’s total liability shall not exceed the value of the Contract. Nothing contained in these terms and conditions may be read or construed as excluding any liability for death or personal injury caused by WeeCasa’s negligence or liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. These terms and conditions will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Colorado, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles.
